"""Multi-stem audio isolation via Demucs (standalone feature).

Stage-1 guitar model (2026-08-24, updated 2026-08-29): keep ``htdemucs_6s`` as
the **default** first-stage separator whenever a dedicated ``guitar`` stem is
required and no optional extra is installed. Do not swap the default to
``htdemucs`` / ``htdemucs_ft`` (no guitar stem). Lead vs rhythm remains a
*post-process* on that single guitar stem — see ``eval/lead_rhythm/README.md``.

2026-08-29 guitar-quality decision: ``htdemucs_6s`` has no dedicated guitar
head — its guitar stem bleeds bass/drums/cymbals/vocals and loses clean
content, and folding the full ``other`` stem back into guitar reintroduces
piano/keys. Opt-in engines that beat it on guitar SDR (MVSep: BS-RoFormer-SW
guitar ~9.05 dB vs guitar "not established" for htdemucs_6s):

- ``bs_roformer_sw`` — jarredou BS-RoFormer-SW 6-stem, mirrored at
  ``enerjazzer/BS-ROFO-SW-Fixed`` after the original HF account was deleted.
  Weights have **no stated license**. Requires optional ``.[roformer]``
  (``bs-roformer-infer``) or ``.[separator]`` (``audio-separator``).
- ``melband_roformer_guitar`` / ``IsolateConfig.guitar_refine`` — becruily
  MelBand-Roformer Guitar 2-stem specialist as a second-pass refine.
  Requires optional ``.[separator]``.
- ``guitar_scnet`` — SCNet 4-stem (MUSDB18, ~10.6M params) via optional
  ``.[scnet]``; a dedicated-guitar engine is not what it outputs, so guitar is
  mapped from its ``other`` stem (fuzzier than ``bs_roformer_sw`` but a real
  SDR jump over stock 6s). Weights MIT-friendly (UVR mirror, SHA256-pinned).
- ``htdemucs_6s_guitar_ft`` stays Advanced opt-in (smallest gain).

Default path stays Demucs-only and backwards-compatible on time: smarter
``fold_other_mode="best_effort"`` (band-limited / skip piano-like ``other``)
instead of dumping the residual mix into guitar. New ML is never the default.

Bass/guitar bleed (2026-07-17): distorted/overdriven bass and electric guitar
share heavily overlapping spectral and timbral content, so Demucs (including
``htdemucs_6s``) does not always keep them cleanly separated — the ``guitar``
stem can carry audible bass energy. This is a documented, model-level
limitation (see facebookresearch/demucs issue #291) — not a bug in this
repo's post-processing. ``htdemucs_ft`` does not have this specific failure
mode because it never produces a ``guitar`` stem. See
``eval/lead_rhythm/README.md``, ``BassBleedDiagnostics``, and
``IsolateConfig.bass_bleed_mitigation``.

Two-pass (opt-in ``IsolateConfig.two_pass`` / ``--two-pass``): 4-stem
``htdemucs`` then ``htdemucs_6s`` on the leftover mix. About 2× time. Not
the default. Guitar refine is a separate opt-in stage.
